                "answer": "Oxidase, TSI, nitrate reduction, growth on MacConkey agar",
                "explanation": "NFB will grow on the slant of TSI or KIA, but they do not acidify the butt (glucose fermentation), as do the Enterobacteriaceae. NFB can be cytochrome oxidase positive or negative, but all the Enterobacteriaceae species, except Plesiomonas shigelloides, are oxidase negative. Enterobacteriaceae species grow well on MacConkey agar and reduce nitrate to nitrite, but NFB grow poorly or not at all on MacConkey and most do not reduce nitrate. Nearly 70% of NFB recovered from clinical specimens are strains of P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"

                "explanation": "The use of OF tubes helps to determine the presumption of a nonfermentative bacillus (glucose oxidation positive and glucose fermentation negative). The positive cytochrome oxidase test and pigment production indicate a possible Pseudomonas species. Several NFB produce pigments that aid in species identification: P. aeruginosa produces yellow pyoverdins (fluorescein) and/or pyocyanin (blue aqua pigment).

The diazonium compound complexes with α-naphthylamine, forming a red product. Media containing nitrates are used for the identification of nonfermenters. When testing nonfermenters, it is wise to confirm a negative reaction using zinc dust. The diazonium compound detects nitrite only, and the organism may have reduced nitrates to nitrogen, ammonia, nitrous oxide, or hydroxylamine. Zinc ions reduce residual nitrates in the media to nitrites. A red color produced after addition of zinc indicates the presence of residual nitrates, confirming a true negative reaction. If a red or pink color does not occur after adding zinc, then the organism reduced the nitrate to a product other than nitrite, and the result is considered positive"
